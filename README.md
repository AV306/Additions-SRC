Source for AdditionsMC Java mod!

Note: everythinng below v1.3.0 is deprecated. I am drowning while trying to clean up everything aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

# How to Use

1. Install Minecraft Forge 1.15.3.31.2.0. Make sure it is *31.2.0*! It will *not* work with anything that is not 1.15.2.31.2.0. I do not know why.
2. Load FML once.
3. Copy the mod jar to the mods folder. (C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\\.minecraft (or the gamedir if you set a custom one)\mods\)
4. Load FML and check that AdditionsMC is installed.
5. You're good to go! Have fun!
